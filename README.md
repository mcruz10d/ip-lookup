# Modern IP Lookup & Minecraft Server Monitor â€” Geolocation

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/mcruz10d/ip-lookup?label=Releases&color=2b9348)](https://github.com/mcruz10d/ip-lookup/releases)

A modern web app for IP lookup and live Minecraft server monitoring. It detects visitor IPs, runs manual lookups with fallback APIs, monitors BDZONE server status in real time, and ships a responsive UI. The app runs serverless on Vercel and uses Express-style serverless functions and Node.js for API logic.

Live demo screenshots and deployment details follow. Use the Releases link above to get packaged builds or assets.

Architecture
- Front end
  - Static site built with modern HTML/CSS/JS.
  - Responsive components and small client bundle.
  - Uses fetch to call serverless API endpoints.
- Serverless API (Vercel)
  - Node.js functions that expose REST endpoints.
  - Lightweight Express-like router.
  - Endpoints for IP lookup, geolocation fallback, Minecraft ping, and BDZONE status.
- Caching
  - In-memory cache per function invocation and optional external cache.
  - TTL for geolocation and server status values.
- External services
  - Up to three geolocation providers used in a fallback chain.
  - Minecraft ping protocol to query server status.
  - Optional webhook or push for status changes.

API Endpoints
- GET /api/ip
  - Returns detected IP and basic metadata.
  - Example response: { ip: "1.2.3.4", type: "ipv4" }
- POST /api/lookup
  - Accepts JSON { ip: "1.2.3.4" }
  - Returns geolocation results aggregated from APIs.
  - Uses primary provider first, then fallbacks if the provider fails or returns low confidence.
- GET /api/bdzone/status
  - Returns BDZONE cluster status and list of online servers.
- GET /api/mc/ping?host=example.com&port=25565
  - Pings a Minecraft server (Java edition) and returns ping, MOTD, version, and players.
- GET /api/health
  - Lightweight health check for uptime monitoring.

Minecraft monitoring (BDZONE)
- BDZONE is a monitored Minecraft network. The monitor queries known BDZONE endpoints.
- The monitor runs ping checks at configurable intervals.
- The server ping uses the Minecraft Server List Ping protocol for Java edition.
- For each server the API returns:
  - host, port, online status, latency (ms), motd, version, players (online/max), sample players.
- The front end shows live status and player names where available.
- The monitor supports read-only queries. It never performs login or interactive actions.

Installation
- Requirements
  - Node.js 18+ for local development.
  - Vercel account for serverless deployment.
- Clone the repo
  - git clone https://github.com/mcruz10d/ip-lookup.git
  - cd ip-lookup

Run a release build
- Visit the Releases page and download the packaged asset for your platform:
  - https://github.com/mcruz10d/ip-lookup/releases
- The release asset includes a run script and build files.
- Example steps after download:
  - tar -xzf ip-lookup-x.y.z.tar.gz
  - cd ip-lookup-x.y.z
  - chmod +x ip-lookup-start.sh
  - ./ip-lookup-start.sh
- The run script starts a local static server and a serverless emulator for testing the functions.
- The run script name may vary by platform:
  - Linux/macOS: ip-lookup-start.sh
  - Windows: ip-lookup-start.ps1 or ip-lookup-start.bat
- Use the release package when you want a prebuilt bundle and stable binaries.

Environment variables
- The serverless functions read these env vars:
  - GEO_PRIMARY_API_KEY - primary geolocation API key
  - GEO_SECONDARY_API_KEY - secondary geolocation API key
  - GEO_TERTIARY_API_KEY - tertiary geolocation API key
  - CACHE_TTL - cache time to live in seconds (default 300)
  - BDZONE_SERVERS - comma list of BDZONE hosts to monitor
  - VERCEL - set by the Vercel platform
- Set these in local .env for development:
  - GEO_PRIMARY_API_KEY=abc123
  - CACHE_TTL=300
- The code falls back to public free APIs when keys are missing.

Local development
- Install dependencies
  - npm install
- Run local serverless emulator (vercel or local server)
  - npm run dev
- Access the site at http://localhost:3000
- Run unit tests
  - npm test
- Debug functions with a serverless emulator or the Vercel CLI:
  - npm i -g vercel
  - vercel dev
- Use curl to test the API:
  - curl http://localhost:3000/api/ip
  - curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"ip":"8.8.8.8"}' http://localhost:3000/api/lookup

Deploy to Vercel
- Connect the GitHub repo to Vercel.
- Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard.
- Configure build and output settings:
  - Build command: npm run build
  - Output folder: .vercel/output or /dist depending on framework
- Vercel auto-deploys on push to main.
- Use Vercel serverless functions for the API files in /api.

Rate limits & fallback APIs
- The app uses a fallback strategy to avoid hitting provider rate limits.
- Strategy:
  - Try primary provider.
  - On error or cached low confidence result, try secondary.
  - On failure, query tertiary.
  - Aggregate results and return best match.
- Cache responses to reduce calls.
- Set CACHE_TTL to control reuse frequency.
- If you hit rate limits, add or replace providers with your own API keys.

Security & CORS
- The API sets CORS headers to allow the static front end to call serverless functions.
- Use proper API keys in server-side env vars.
- The front end never stores private keys.
- Sanitize IP input on /api/lookup.
- The project supports HTTPS when deployed on Vercel.

FAQ
- How do I add a geolocation provider?
  - Add a provider module under /lib/providers and wire its key in env.
- How do I add a new BDZONE server?
  - Add host:port to BDZONE_SERVERS env var or config file.
- How often does the monitor poll servers?
  - Default poll interval is set in config. Adjust CACHE_TTL or poll settings.
